w = 274 characters

max step = 2 * len(w) - 1 = 547 if it is CNF context free grammar
but we have Rn and Ar always be together
Sometimes Y is in the sentence too


C Rn X Ar           increase 4 - 1 = 3
C Rn X Y X Ar       increase 6 - 1 = 5
C Rn X Y X Y X Ar   increase 8 - 1 = 7

X Rn X Ar
X Rn X Y X Ar


other operation increases the length by 1
=> the length of string always increase => there is only 1 way to construct this string

we can consider Y to associate with its previous X -> just - 2*Y and consider all Rn Ar to be increase 3 operation

31 Rn -> 31 Ar
-> 31 operation increases 3
8 Y
just - 8*2
number of increase 1: 274 - 31 * 3 - 8 * 2 - 1 = 164
ans = 164 + 31 = 195
